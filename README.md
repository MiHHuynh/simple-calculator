# Simple Calculator

## Introduction

A simple calculator implementation handling adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing of both whole and decimal numbers. This currently does NOT follow operator precedence (it calculates left to right).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The only dependences that this solution has are:

* HTML
* (plain) CSS
* (vanilla) JavaScript

### Installing

Clone and `cd` into the directory via the terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/MiHHuynh/simple-calculator.git
cd simple-calculator
```

Files will be in this structure:

```
.
├── README.md
├── index.html
├── reset.css
├── script.js
└── style.css
```

Open the `index.html` file in your browser. For example:

```
file:///Users/<USERNAME>/<DIRECTORY CONTAINING CLONED REPO>/simple-calculator/index.html
```

## Functionality

Input will take as many digits per number and as many concatenated chunks of number and operation as desired. The result is shown on the display screen when an expression is fully ended with a hit of the equal sign button.
